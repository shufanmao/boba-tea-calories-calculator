#milk-tea-calories-calculator

The primary goal of this project is to develop an interactive web application that enables users to understand the nutritional content of bubble tea drinks, specifically focusing on caloric intake. Users can easily calculate the calories for a certain customized drink among the provided brands. By comparing the drink calories with healthy food equivalents, the project aims to promote awareness about dietary choices and encourage healthier consumption patterns, empowering users with the knowledge to make informed decisions.![image](https://github.com/shufanmao/shufanmao-milk-tea-calories-calculator/assets/123994752/1fa530ab-9490-4b21-b192-1eb4247d2e38)
